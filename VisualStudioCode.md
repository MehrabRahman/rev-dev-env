# Visual Studio Code
An extensible, open source, and cross platform text editor that can be customized to serve as a text editor, an IDE, and anything in between. While a popular tool of choice for front end development, several first-party extensions from Microsoft now support Java development as well.

## Getting Started with Java and VSCode
Visual Studio Code is freely available for download on Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms. The Java Extension Pack from Microsoft will require Java to be installed as well. While both can be installed independently, both can be installed together along with the extension pack: [Visual Studio Code for Java Developers](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win)
